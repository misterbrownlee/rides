			<div>I don't really remember heading to bed on Friday, but when I woke up, whatever was 
            inside my head (certainly not a brain) was several sizes too big for my skull.
             When my roommate started rustling through his gear, I took that as my cue to   
           	<div class="photoRight">

           	down ibuprofen, shower, and pack. Brian had decided the rear tire on his CBR didn't 
            have another 1000 miles of hard riding left on it, and was packing up to head home. 
            I decided to skip breakfast, opting to walk around in the cold morning air and try to
            clear my head. The town of June Lake is nice, though not much goes on at the crack of 
            dawn on Saturday.  There are plenty of discrete places to lean over and dry heave, however, 
            if that's what you're into.</div>
            
            <div>While I was enjoying my clandestine activities, I heard a 
            familiar buzz, and looked up to see Brian's CBR lazily rolling by in second.  He offered 
            me a one-finger salute on his way past, which I was happy to return.  Not much later I 
            noticed most riders were getting geared up, so I returned to the VFR and brought it to life.  
            I worried that wearing a helmet was going to make the situation worse, but for some reason
            having pressure outside my head made the pressure inside feel better.  Moving through the 
            crisp air helped with the cobwebs, and by the time we stopped for fuel outside of June Lake 
            I was feeling half decent.</div><br/>
            
            <div class="subTitle">Running Wide</div>
            <div>We connected on Hwy 120 again, rolling through sparse pine forest, up and down gentle hills, 
            the road unfolding itself into the high Nevada desert.  The tress and turns gave way to straights 
            and sweepers, with not much on the side of the road other than sage brush and sand.  Just a few miles 
            down Hwy 120, after a few rolling twists, the road heads slightly downhill into a fast sweeping left.

           	</div>  
            The sight lines are perfect, and one could really give it the stick here, if one was inclined.  Or, 
            one look ahead through the corner and see a collection of parked bikes, and another bike down.  As 
            I rode up, instinct told me there had been a high-speed get off.  As I got closer, I saw the bike, 
            by itself in the dirt.  I also saw a prone rider, face down in the sand, and thought to myself "Damn, 
            it's a bad one"!  When I recognized the rider's yellow helmet, an even worse feeling sank in.  The 
            downed rider was Duffy, my new friend, the E.O.M.B. member who had invited me on the run!  I had no 
            idea how bad his condition was, just that he was still on the ground, and he did not seem to be moving.  
            A couple riders were leaned down close, which I hoped was a sign they were talking to him.</div><br/>
            
            <div>Thus it came to pass that the validity of sand and sage brush as run off was tested.  The verdict is that, sure, this is 
            somewhat better than guard-rails, cliffs, rocks, and trees.  Unless, of course, the front wheel of your Honda 919 finds 
            it's way into a 2' deep stream bed and lawn-darts itself into the loose sand at the bottom.  
            Try this while running just a wee bit wide going somewhere north of 80mph.  The resulting dismount, 
            tumble, and yard sale will not be pretty. The bike ended up about 100 feet from where it left the pavement, 
            lying on its side, with lots of newly bent parts.  The rider ended up another 30 feet further, out cold and 
            banged up pretty good. His tank bag set the record, flying another 100 feet or so from where the bike stopped! 
            A couple of Bros knelt in the sand next to Duffy, trying to assess his condition.  I keep a fair bit back and waited, 
            relieved only that there seemed to be no extreme urgency, no charge of a adreline that leaps from person to 
            person when a truly huge danger is present.   After a minute or two of waiting, the downed rider moved, 
            and I realized I had been holding my breath.  Tension gave way to relief.  Now it was a matter of damage 
            control, which I was coming to find out is an E.O.M.B. specialty.  The details of getting Humpty-Duffy 
            together again were worked out, using the usual E.O.M.B. technique; consensus by yelling.  The bike's 
            bars were rotated to a driveable position, the gravel was removed from the bead of the front tire, and 
            a few other adjustments were made.  Duffy expressed genuine regret for screwing up, as it was clear 
            he would not be able to continue.  After verifying he and his ride were fit enough to limp back to 
            civilization, Duffy was escorted by another Bro back to June Lake, while the rest of use mounted 
            up and continued toward Death Valley.  For the E.O.M.B., the road must go on.

            </div>
            Go on is exactly what we did, though at a slightly more sober pace.  We finished up 
            with Hwy 120, which included a section called 'The Super Whoops'.  We made good time, 
            had a quick re-group at Benton Hot Springs, then turned south on Hwy 6, doing ticket-avoiding 
            speeds all the way into Bishop.  There the group stopped for lunch, and made good use of the 
            motorcycle dealership in town.  After Bishop we rolled down Hwy 395 to Big Pine for fuel, 
            then picked up Hwy 168 where it turns West off of Hwy 395.  If you ever have reason to be 
            out in that area, do not miss riding Hwy 168.  Better yet, make Hwy 168 your reason.  This 
            is one of the better slabs I've been on.  It starts with an amazing, winding section that 
            travels up a small canyon.  Then the road crests a ridge and winds back down into the desert, 
            with rollers, sweepers, and screaming, open stretches.  Most if it has great sight lines, new 
            pavement with lots of grip, good camber, and not a lot of traffic. Our pace started to pick 
            up again, especially when crossing the flat expanses of desert that connect the hills and ridges.  
            At this point the VFR and I were seriously bonding, hitting that compromise was between fast and fun, 
            where you can truly let go and feel one with the bike.  Enjoying even a scant few minutes of that bond 
            is what makes me sure I'll be a motorcycle rider for life.</div><br/>

            
            <p>After the spirited (spiritual?) blast on Hwy 168, we stopped to regroup where Hwy 168 meets 
            Hwy 266, at a spot called Oasis Ranch.  Here it was decided the KTM 950 Adventure riders should 
            do a rolling-start drag race against the BMW 1200 GS.  This test was repeated a couple of times, 
            and I even put the VFR into the mix, just for fun.  After messing around there, we continued on 
            Hwy 266 West.  This stretch was mostly straight and open sweepers, cutting across some of the 
            most desolate land in the country.  There was a fierce wind out of the north, which forced a 
            degree of restraint into the throttle hand, but straights that extended to the horizon just 
            beg for triple digits.  I've heard stories from others about going flat out on this road, 
            only to be 'buzzed' by military jets that were using them as a target for simulated bombing 
            runs!  Nothing like getting the wing-nod from a low-flying jet to confirm that you are, in 
            fact, hauling serious ass!</p>

	           	</div>
            
            <div>Our next re-group was where Hwy 266 meets Hwy 95, in the parking lot of the abandoned Cottontail Brothel.  
            The place was borded up, so there was nobody to hanky our panky.  Instead, we entertained ourselves by zooming 
            around the parking lot, putting stickers on just about anything that stood still, and riding street bikes to 
            the top of a nearby gravel pile.  I'm not talking about the big dual sport bikes that conquered the towering 
            dirt mound.  In fact, it was another rider on 5th Gen VFR that made first tracks!  I was impressed, but 
            decided the proof-of-concept was good enough.  My VFR was perfectly happy remaining on solid ground.  
            At the top, the rider spun the rear wheel and showered roost on all below, until his rear wheel sunk 
            down to the axle and the bike stood up without the side stand.  Good times!</div>
        
            <p>From there, the swarm headed south on Hwy 95.  Despite plenty of warning from our elders not 
            to violate the 70mph posted limit, one rider managed to get popped doing 110mph. Such are the 
            risks of the big bore a sport bike.  It starts off trying to pass someone going 68mph, and a few 
            seconds later you're north of 100mph, and the needle just keeps going.  If a cop crests the hill 
            in front of you, guess what?  You're buying drinks for 20 or more of your friends, as they laugh 
            their ass off and encourage you to keep up the good work.</p>
        
            <p>Soon we were in our stop for the night, which was Beatty, Nevada, the gateway to Death 
            Valley.  You my find it interesting to know that many auto makers use Beatty as a base of 
            operations for hot weather testing.  Or not.  I discovered this bit of information, along 
            with many other fascinating things, while looking at the collection of pictures, notes, 
            and assorted car parts that were displayed on the walls of the Sourdough Bar.  This 
            was where a few of us had dinner, and a good time was had by all. I decided to avoid a 
            repeat of the previous nights hazy antics, and the hangover that followed, and keep a 
            close watch on my gin and tonic count.  A respectable dust storm had started to blow 
            through town, making the scant street lights seem like islands in a swirl of blackness.  
            The extra-vigilent sherrif was spotted, lurking like a shark on the side streets, watching 
            for the slightest infraction.  With an almost comical display of good behavior, we tip-toed 
            our machines through the maelstrom of sand and grit, back to the hotel.  Due to a bizarre 
            mixup, we were lodged in a hotel that was still under construction.  The rough nature of 
            the site, combined with surreal light, gusting wind, and blasting dust, made it feel like 
            were were riding to Moon Base Alpha, not a cheap hotel in a strange little town in Nevada.</p>

            <p>Soon, the VFR was at anchor, and I was tucked into my plasticy hotel blanket. I went to sleep 
            feeling excited,  knowing the door step to Death Valley was near.  I had survived another day, 
            the VFR and I were like a single being, and was finding a place in the group.  I had been on 
            some of the best roads of my life, seen some amazing scenery, heard a ton of great stories, 
            and laughed more than you can imagine. All this, and there was still two more days of riding ahead!</p>
