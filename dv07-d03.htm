            <div class="subTitle">Sunday</div>     
            
            <div>The next day started early.  The plan was to ride into 
            Death Valley for a late breakfast at 
            Panamint Springs.  At departure time, I realized my cell 
            phone was missing in action.  A few
            folks were still gassing up, so I lurked off to rummage my 
            hotel room. I was sure losing my phone would

            mean buying a round of drinks, but luckily the phone was 
            right where I had left it.  I made it brisky back   
            to the group just as everyone was finally ready to leave. Whew!</div>
            
            <p>We motored out of Beatty on Hwy 95, and within a couple of minutes 
            we were into some serious Death Valley scenery.  Just then we found one 
            KTM Adventure riders stopped on the side of the road.  The dual sport 
            riders had left earlier, planning to follow a dirt road that entered 
            the park via Titus Canyon.  Sadly, this KTM had gone lame, and was 
            left behind to survive on it's own. It turns out the skid plate had 
            come un-bolted and partially fell off.  This was after being serviced 
            by a KTM dealer, who apparently didn't have a torque wrench handy.  
            Our small group stopped to affect a quick repair on the KTM.   
            I snapped some photos of the scenery, and all was well again. </p>
        
			<div class="subTitle">The Coasting Race</div> 
            <p>Once back on the road, we traveled a few more miles, until another sort of 
            chaos broke out.  As I crested a hill, I saw bikes in various states of stopped, 
            taking up both lanes, all pointed down the hill ahead.  I got on the brakes, 
            wondering what everyone's problem was.  Then, one of the riders put a foot down, 
            and then skateboard-style pushed with all his might.  I realized what was going 
            on; it was the coasting race!  I had heard stories about a tradition of having a 
            coasting race somewhere on the route into Death Valley.  Now, the race was on! I 
            quickly halted, found neutral, and started pushing with all my might.  Sure, I 
            was late to the start, but I wanted to give it a good effort. The two lead bikes 
            were already going around the next bend, but were plenty of others just ahead that 
            I could dice with.  I tucked in small and aimed for the rear tire of the closest rider.</p>
            
            <p>My days of racing an RS125 taught me the value of a good tuck and the advantages of drafting.  
            You can get a big boost by using the draft of another rider.  In a coasting race, if you carry 
            momentum through the pocket of low-resistance behind another rider, you can sling-shot past 
            and pick up extra speed as you go by.  After using this technique to pass two or three riders, 
            I was moving at a pretty good clip, maybe 40 mph or more.  That was when the road got a bit curvy.  
            I picked the cleanest lines I could and stayed well away from the brake lever.  Within a few minutes 
            I was in third place and slowing gaining ground on the two leaders!</p>

           	</div>
           	<div>One of them was on an FJ1300, the other was on a ZX11.  Both had plenty of mass, 
            but the VFR is no lightweight, so I held out hope.  My good aerodynamic posture 
            was offset by the fact that the riders ahead were not tucked in at all.  
            Instead, they trying to grab each others bikes!  Get a hand on your opponent's 
            bike and you can pull yourself forward to get more speed.  Of course, if you 
            get close enough to grab them, they're close enough, to grab you!  This leads 
            to a lot of veering across the road, slapping at each other's hands, vigorous 
            defense of your brake levers, some familiar finger gestures, and lots of 
            bullying each other for the line.   As I neared the battle, I got a quick lesson 
            in the 'anything goes' spirit of the race.</div><br/>
            
            <div>Just as the ZX gained an advantage, I slipped into the FJ's draft.  Seeing me approaching on the left,
            the rider blocked me with his foot and inched across the lane, forcing me over the double yellow.  
            A turn was coming, so I tried to grab his bike for a push. This caused him to retreat, and we entered the corner barely 
            in our lane.  Meanwhile, the ZX was inching away!  I attempted to pass the 
            FJ again, leaning way off and forward to grab his side luggage.  He tried to 
            move me left again, but as we crossed the center line, I stole a boost 
            off his side luggage.  This was enough of a difference, 
            and I started to pull out a gap, the FJ just barely missing my draft.  A few 
            moments later I was close enough pick up a draft from the ZX.  I noticed his 
            mirrors were adjusted down, so he could see behind him tucked on the tank!  
            This guy was E.O.M.B. coasting race old school.  I was in for a good battle.</div><br/>
            
            <div>I first tried a simple drafting pass, while defending myself from tampering.  
            After a protracted hand-slapping duel, nobody gained an advantage. Defensive 
            measures added too much drag.  I retreated to his back wheel, knowing I 
            needed a plan.  The ZX had no side luggage, and integrated rear turn signals, so there 
            was almost nothing to grab for a boost. I figured another slingshot was worth a try, 
            hoping the VRF and I had an aerodynamic advantage.  We were on a long 
            straight, so the other lane was fair game. I tucked in, dove as close to his back wheel as I dared, 
            then made my move.  Knowing what would come next, I cut hard across the road, 
            hoping to avoid having to defend my bike from his reach. He cut across 
            with me, then retreated back to the right lane.  With a right turn coming up fast, the ZX waited at 
            the double yellow, blocking me out of his lane.  He was thinking I would be forced to brake 
            and drop in behind him, but this guy obviously didn't know who he was dealing with.  
            I cut back over aggressively, forcing him to the right with a 'stuff you' corner
            entry that would have made Valentino Rossi proud.  It occurred to me I 
            could keep going right and see how he liked riding in the dirt.  Since he was an 
            E.O.M.B. member, and I was a guest, I figured that might not go over well. I did take 
            him right to the paint, to see if he would back down.  Silly me. We exited the corner 
            bar to bar, hugging the edge of the road, with another grabbing and slapping duel underway.</div><br/>
            
            <div>We were on the last stretch.  The road went straight for a mile or so, ending in 
            a T intersection.  It occurred to me that I had no idea where the official finish line was, but 
            it did take a genius to the end of the course was approaching.  Just then, four Harley-dudes rolled 
            past us, and they were obviously not happy.   You would think their mood would have been better.  
            After all, how often do Harley's get to pass a couple of sport bikes?  Instead, they 
            were quite un-gracious, apparently upset that our 
            race strategy included veering all over the road while trying to slap each other 
            into the dirt.  Each rider gave us that grumpy, Harely look. Well, all except 
            one guy, who was laughing his ass off.</div><br/>
        	   
            <div>As they passed, the coasting race heated up again.  Despite a vigorous defense, 
            my rival got a small push off from my side luggage.  I desperately leaned as far off as I could  
            and briefly hooked two fingers on a bungie as he rolled by.  
            That tiny bit of contact made us just about even.  We both went into a tuck, putting all our chips on coasting.  
            The bikes were picking up speed.

   			</div>
            
           	The end of the road quickly loomed ahead.  With no clear finish line, the vibe 
           	had changed to a game of chicken, using the intersection ahead like the 
           	cliff in 'Rebel Without A Cause'.  Then I noticed the grumpy Harely dudes were parked in 
           	the intersection ahead.  I decided to cut my losses.  Maybe I would have eeked out a 
           	first? Or, maybe I would have become a red plastic bowling ball, smashing through 
           	chromed Milwaukee pins?  I don't have a taste for the wipe-outs and knuckle-sandwiches, 
           	and those guys were already grumpy enough. I backed off, and the ZX surged ahead.  
           	The race over, we braked hard, dodged the Harley's, and stopped on the side of the road. </div>
           	
           	<p>Before we could dismount, we exchanged hearty shouts and back slapping.  We were both about 
           	as high as you can get, like MotoGP stars in the winner's circle, except at stop sign in Death Valley, with no 
           	champagne and no umbrella girls.  The rest of the group arrived, everyone just as 
           	excited.  As helmets came off, heated debates started about the skirmishes 
           	that took place.  There was energy in the air, ripples of a force that united the group, 
           	even as they argued.  I wasn't sure if it was excitement, stupidity, or 
           	a warped sense of humor, but what ever it was, the link was undeniable.</p>
        
            <p>As the arguing wound down, we drove further into the park.  We passed some amazing scenery, including a massive field of sand dunes that had formed in them middle of the valley.  Just past the dunes, we stopped at a visitor center, to wait for the Titus Canyon off-road group rejoin the fold.  To kill time we bought post cards, made souvigner pennies, relaxed, and indulged in some smack talking.  During the break, an E.O.M.B member who was not on the ride showed up in his car.  He had been on a separate trip with is family, was in the area, and decided to see if he could spot the Death Valley ride as it passed through.  Soon the off-road group arrived, and after a bit more gab and some sitting around in the the shade, we mounted up and rolled on to the next adventure.</p>
            
            <div class="subTitle">Wildrose Road and Panamint Springs</div>
            <div class="photoLeft">

           	</div>
           	
            <p>After a brief stint on Hwy 190, the group turned onto a twisty bit of madness called Wildrose Road.  If you like riding on poorly maintained chip-seal, the this is the road for you.  It was an eyes-open all the time roller coaster, with sweepers and straights changing to twisty canyon sections with little or no warning.  Add to that a smattering of loose gravel and some rocks, plus the typical sand paper surface of chip-seal, and you have the makings of some really great crashing.  Just ask the guy who low sided and slid off exiting a particularly tight, up-hill left.  I rolled up about 4th to the scene, just after the downed rider had picked up his KTM and pushed it out of the impact zone.  I checked my speed a bit, stopping on the shoulder ahead.  I had been off the bike for just a few seconds when I heard the unmistakeable sound of aluminum and ABS getting 'road polished'.  Another rider had tucked the front on the brakes and skidding off in the exact same spot!  It seemed like the crashing bug was contagious.</p>
              <div class="photoRight">

            </div>
            <p>The rest of the group managed to get through the turn without decking it.  A few of us hung around while the crashed bikes were repaired.  The 950 Adventure was a minor spill, so the rider had nothing more than scratched crash guards.  The SV650 didn't handle being thrown down as gracefully.  I got to witness (again) how the E.O.M.B can make a foot rest and gear shift lever magically appear in the middle of nowhere.  All they needed was a broken rearset, a bit of electrical tape, a few hose-clamps, some spare bolts, and several well chosen swear words.  Soon, the SV was road worthy, and off we went again.</p>
            
            <div>Our path took us further down Wildrose Road, after which we turned onto Panamint Valley Rd.  
          
            This was in bad shape for 3 miles or so, as it passed through a small canyon in the 
            hills.  Once we dropped into to the next valley, the road straightened out and the 
            pavement got better.  In fact, it got good enough to tap out 6th gear for a bit.  
            In a short time we arrived at Panamint Springs, where lunch was being served. The 
            staff at the restaurant were caught a bit off guard, but did their best to make 
            the 18 Bloody Marys, 9 bacon cheese burgers, and an assortment of beers, sodas, 
            and other edibles.  One E.O.M.B. rider was forced to buy a round of drinks, as 
            punishment for I forget what, so merriment was made, fries and burgers were 
            wolfed down, and stories were recounted.  It was a great place to relax, with a
             sprawling porch that offered a good view of the landscape.  However, worries 
             over the ratio of miles to daylight prevailed, so we were soon on our bikes 
             and hauling ass again.</div><br/>
             <div class="photoLeft">

           	</div>
            <p>Our route continued on Hwy 190 from Panamint all the way to Olancha.  Driving through 
            the rest of the park was beautiful, and the road was quite fun. 
            I didn't catch much of the scenery, though, as my focus was mostly on keeping up 
            with the Bros.  That, and waving thanks to the many, many, many cars full of 
            tourists that we dusted off in the process.  At Olancha we hooked back up with 
            Hwy 395 and headed south, stopping in Pearsonville for gas.  From there, we 
            doubled back on Hwy 395, to catch the start of our cut over through Sherman Pass, 
            about 5 miles north.  As our lead group finished gassing up, and was pulling back 
            onto the highway to head north, the next group of 8 or so riders was just arriving 
            in Pearsonville on the south side of the highway.  Of course, all the south bound 
            riders were giving us the one-finger salute, which we gladly returned.  The whole 
            group finally got back together at the foot of Nine Mile Canyon Road.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="subTitle">Nine Mile Canyon and Sherman Pass</div> 
            <p>Yes, that's really the name of the road.  I was a bit busy, and didn't watch the odometer to verify the Nine Mile part, but it sure as heck was a canyon. Yes, it was fun to ride.  I made a half hearted attempt to keep up with the group ahead of me; a Hayabusa, a couple of V-Stroms, a 950 Adventure, and a GSXR750 among them.  I thought for sure at least one of them would be going VFR speed, but found myself quickly losing touch.  I resorted to going harder down the straight, and later on the brakes, which didn't lend it's to a flowing ride. Turn after turn I found the gap stretching a bit every time, and the chance of disaster felt a little too close for comfort.  Admitting my mortality, I settled into a pace that was bit more sane.  The sun was going down, which means bad light, colder temperatures, and increased chance of deer.  Having seen how crashing was becoming more the rule than the exception, I put double concentration into keeping upright. Just as we got into the serious alpine roads of Sherman Pass, I came across another wrinkle in the plan.  This time it was not a crash, merely a flat rear tire on another of the KTMs.  We stood around for a while while some of the guys replaced the tube. You may be wondering, "how many Moto Bro's does it take to fix a flat?" The answer is "However many are within yelling distance". Of course, no spare rear tube was available, so a patch was attempted that didn't work.  A last resort was to use a spare front tube, and hope for the best.</p>
            
            <p>When we took off again, I hooked up with 5 other guys who set a pretty good pace.  Once we got a feel for the conditions of the road, our pace picked up a bit, and the group thinned to three.  The road was a mess - rocks, sand, pine cones, pot holes, patches, drop offs with no guard rail, etc.  This thing made Mines Rd or Wildrose Rd look like The Autobaun!  The sun was low and we were heading west, so as we continued down from the pass, many of the corners had to face directly into the sun.  On top of all the road treachery, I took many corner one handed, so I could block the glare with my left hand.  Still, I was in a good rhythm, so I had no trouble keeping up with the guys I was with. </p>  
            
            <p>On the way down, we stopped to admire a massive scar in the pavement.  Something big had obviously decked it, and the gouge went straight across the road and off the far side of the turn.  We peered over the bank, but there was nobody there.  Someone had been unlucky, or lucky, depending on how you see things.  Once we got lower, the light evened out, the surrounding trees gave way to sand and sagebrush, and the site lines got a little better.  That shift started to happen, where everything unfolds in a wider, slower time-scale, a distortion that only good groove can produce.  Roll it on, blast the straight, then squeeze on some brakes, start your lean and trail it in, glide through the apex, crack the gas back on, ease the tires back upright, roll on some throttle, and launch it down toward the next turn. Repeat as necessary.  Soon, that rhythm morphed into that trancendent dance that I've come to love so much. Turn after turn, we picked our way down.  Before long I was dogging a rear wheel, next I had put a pass on one, then two.  The VFR, the road, and I spoke subconsciously, and I was 100% focused, leading our charge down the hill.  The visit to a recent crash site kept the voice of reality in the mix, but the VFR was lobbing me softballs and I was smashing them out of the park. </p> 
            
            <p>When we got to the bottom I soaring, and we all agreed that, despite the hazards, we had a blast negotiation that road.  When I asked if I had made any bad moves, I was glad to hear they guys didn't mind being passed.  More to the point, their comment was "Hell no - you were hauling ass!" Moments of pride can have a dangerous price tag, but there is nothing like that feeling where it all comes together. Without pushing too hard or going into over the line, a rider can hit all the marks and make some serious time.  For a third day in a row, a relatively short span of flying on the bike reinforced all the joys that a lifetime of riding can hold.</p>

            <div>Once we exited Sherman Pass Rd onto Kern River Hwy, we were only a few miles away from our destination for the evening.  We had reservations for rooms and dinner at McNally's Fairview Lodge.  We pulled up to find most people were already there and busy getting set up in a room.  I took a moment to survey the damage to the Hayabusa, which had gone down, digging the scar we had seen on Sherman Pass.  The rider was okay, if you call a badly sprained wrist and broken collar bone 'okay'.  The Busa was ridable, though the bodywork and Corbin hard luggage were nicely rashed from their trip down the pavement.

            Good thing it hadn't gone off the edge, or I'm sure the entire MotoBro crew would have been up on Sherman Pass, for as long as it took to hoist it back from the grave.</div>
            
            <p>Once settled, we took over the bar for a few rounds before dinner.  There had been 4 crashes that day, plus a speeding ticket from the day before, all of which meant the offenders had to buy drinks for the group.  We enthusastically started cashing in, and soon the volume was climbing and the conversations got a bit more lively.  We were ushered into our own room for dinner, and proceeded to raise the roof in proper E.O.M.B. fashion.  One highlight of dinner was the rider who purchased "The Logger".  This is a 40oz steak, which was so big it was almost surreal.  Yes, he ate the whole thing, much to the approval of the group.  Another highlight was cashing in two of those rounds of drinks in exchange for a round of desert for everyone.  I ordered a piece of mud pie that was about the size of a football.  I also found out that, during dinner, an unknown perpetrator had snuck into one of the group's rooms and 'tossed' it.  Blankets and matteress where flung all over, gear bags were emptied out, and general mayhem was everywhere.  This is what happens on an E.O.M.B. ride if you leave your hotel room unlocked.  Lucky for me, our room had been locked, and remained sabbatoge free.</p>
            
            <p>After dinner a few of us continued on to the bar and kept the drinks flowing.  The owner of McNally's and his wife were both working that night, an joined us at the bar.  As fellow riders, they had a great time swaping stories with the group, and made sure everyone was well taken care of.  A final tequilla shot put a nice end to the evening, and the last few of us headed to our rooms.  It had been another epic day.</p>
