            <div class="subTitle">Monday</div>       
            <p>Despite the plentiful rounds of free drinks, I woke up with no hangover!  A few of 
            the others weren't as lucky.  It didn't take long for the group to get packed up and 
            ready to go.  We planned a breakfast stop only an hour or so away, at a place called 
            Ponderosa near Quaker Meadows.</p>
            <div class="photoRight">

            <p>The route to breakfast was fun.  We started on Mountian Road 99 or the Kern River Hwy, which follows the Kern River. This route has some good twisties, it is fairly well maintained, and there is nice scenery. The air was crisp,   reminding me of people I've seen use a fairing to take gravel samples outside Turn 2 at Sears. Everyone learns the 'cold pavement, cold tires' lesson one way or the other. The rashed 'busa from yesterday's antics emphasized a need for caution.  We kept a brisk pace, but nobody was feeling heroic.   It wasn't long until we turned off Rt.99, heading north on the Western Divide Hwy.  This brought us into more alpine terrain.  Another rider, who was somewhat new to on-road riding, asked if he could follow me, to watch my lines.  This made me focus on form rather than speed. There was fairly new pavement, wandering over sweeping turns, gaining altitude into the forest hills.  It was tempting to let the VFR rip on the corner exits, but I knew that would likely shake off the beginner behind me.  For my restraint, I was rewarded with an almost hypnotic level of connection with every move of the bike, a quiet enjoyment that can't be found when the edge is being explored.</p>

        
			
            <p>Soon we were at Pondarosa, and the bros took over the restaurant.  The restaurant's staff was on their game, so everyone was chucking back coffee and eggs in no time.  There a lot of miles between us and the Bay Area, so relaxing on the restaurant's sunny porch didn't last long. Some riders topped off with gas, but I had almost 1/2 tank. I decided to run it closer to empty, knowing my race prepped RC45 - ah, sorry - touring loaded RC46 wouldn't miss the extra weight.  The next stretch of road had been lauded as 'The Mother of all Twisties'.  This sounded too good to be true, but after having built a great bond with the VFR, I was eager get the magic rolling.</p>
            <div class="subTitle">Mother of All Twisties</div> 
            <div class="photoLeft">

           	</div>
            <p>It only took a few miles for the faster boys to disappear off the front.  I settled into a good pace and soon the twisties were upon me.  If you have ever ridden this section of Hwy 190, than you know what 'twisties' are all about.  I found it almost hard to believe it was possible to put that many turns in a road and still get anywhere? There are nearly no straights, definitely nothing more than 60 meters or so.  We were in corner carving nirvana!  It got to the point where riding felt almost surreal, a waking dream, turns that turned and turned back, radius after radius, falling and rising, long and short, increasing, decreasing.  There were even turns that  turned in the middle of the turns.  Rubber plied itself to the task, the front whispering caution as it dove in, the rear squirming as the V four growled out of he apex.  Soon my wrists were aching, my legs and arms felt light, and my focus started to wear thin.  For a flash I wondered if I would need to rest before it was over?  I won't say 'The Mother of All Twisties' was too much of a good thing, but it definitely explored the boundaries of that expression.</p>
        
            <p>Of course, with all that turning going on, and the now legendary MotoBro saftey record, it was a huge surprise to come across someone who had decked it.  It was at a point where the road made a downhill, sweeping right that quickly transitioned into in sharp left.  I marveled at how often I had come across the surprise of bikes stopping, and a rider pulled off on the sholder.  A quick chat confirmed that another of the KTM 950 Adventure riders had gone down on the brakes.  The damage was little more than some scrapes on his left side crash guard.  I suppose if you're going to go to the trouble of installing crash guards on your bike, you might as well test them, right?</p>

           	</div>
            <br/>
            <div>The twisties went on for a bit longer, then opened up a bit as we came out of the higher terrain, ending in the town of Springville.  There, the group had a bit of a break, all of us reveling in just how insanely fun "The Mother of all Twisties" had been.  However, there was a shift in the mood.  As charged as we were over the last stretch of road, it also sank in that we were now headed home.  There was no offical route, so I asked a couple guys what the plan might be.  More specifically, I wondered what time we would be back in Oakland.  If we got back early enough, I could pick my wife up from school.  If not, she would be taking the bus.  I wanted a rough idea, so I could call and let her know.  I didn't get a solid answer.  I did get the sense that I should not be asking about the real world, or to dabbling with things like plans or schedules.   Despite the group beginning to split up, with some people making taking a short route north than others, the ride was still underway.</div><br/>
            <br/>

            <div class="subTitle">Heading Home-ish</div>
            <div>Since I was committed to having the most immersive Motobro experience possible, I stuck with the group heading for yet more twisties.  We left Springville on Balch Park Rd, branching onto Yokohl Dr after a few miles.  Soon we were winding our way through the foothills and farms that skirt the south easter edge of California's central valley.  The road itself got a bit intense, a one-lane attention and reflex test, much like Mines or Sherman Pass.  It was quite a contrast to the positive camber, perfect pavement, and wide shoulders of the last road we were on.  Now were back to potholes, patches, blind turns and barbed wire.   I rode a quick but conservative pace.  There were no sweepers here, and the drill was slow it, turn it, fire it out, repeat.  At the re-group I found out one rider was missing, who had gone back to rescue a sleeping bag.  It had come loose, then bounced off the road, down the bank, through 3 barbed wire fences, and finally stopped several hundred feet down the bank.  Check your bungie cords, people!</div><br/>

           	</div>
            <div>In Yokohl we caught Hwy 198, followed that to Citro and Hwy 216, then made quick turn onto Dry Creek Road.  No, not the Dry Creek Road you're thinking of.  In California, that name is second only to 'Main Street' in popularity.  Once again civilaztion faded.  The ever twisting farm road stretched before us, and all tires were on high alert.  We wound our way up to Hwy 245, skirting the edges of the Kings Canyon and Giant Sequoia National Parks.  I'm sure those are nice places, and we rode dangerously close to the sights and their seers.  That was, however, a world well beyond ours.  No sight seeing was being done on Highway 245.  We were MotoBros, warriors of the road, and our mission an apex blasting death march. Highway 245 led us through Deer Crossing to Dunlap Rd, another twisty path, connecting the middle of nowhere to the middle of some other nowhere.  As the day wore on, I realized I had only a rough idea where I was on the planet. Was this day four, or day five?  No time to wonder, I stuck with the group, rode the wheels off my VFR, and enjoyed peripheral flashes scenery.  Location was meaningless information.  Mile after mile had cleansed away all else, my existence was only to brake, turn, apex, accelerate.  Other thoughts had to take a number and wait.  We rode, and rode, and rode, and rode some more.</div>
            
        	<br/>
        	   
            <div>Dunlap Road dropped us onto Hwy 180, which took us through a town called Squaw Valley. From there we took Elwood Road, then North Piedra Road, stopping for gas just after turning again onto Trimmer Springs Rd.  During the stop, I briefly considered heading home.  Another rider who was not a club member was feeling tired, and I was getting a bit burned myself.  When I mentioned the thought of being done, a long time MotoBro asked "when is the next time you'll be out here, where you can ride Trimmer Springs?  You don't want to miss Trimmer".  There was a cruel, philosophical truth to his statement.  I have a compulsion, a need for terrain consumption, such that I don't want to miss riding any road on the planet.  Ever.  I had a rough idea that were were somewhere east of Fresno.    
            
           	That sounded fairly close to home, in a roughly the same 1/2 of my home state sort of way.  My dash clock was showing 2pm, but a dash clock on a motorcycle seemed as irrelevant as ice skates on a camel. There seemed to be no end of twisties in site, and the voice of reason had flown off my shoulder a couple days ago in Nevada.  Just then, someone offered me an ice cream novelty for lunch, and it be came clear what would happen next.  I was on the EOMB Death Valley Run.  I had to finish what I started.</div>
        
            <div>Soon the bikes were filled, the ice cream was gone, our helmets were on, and we were nailing apex after apex.  Trimmer Springs climbed north east, becoming a surreal, nearly perfect stretch of road. A section borders Pine Flat Reservoir, cutting along the hillside, through wooded sections, sloped fields, and twisted live oaks.  The sun was arcing lower, and the grass shone golden behind fences, the long afternoon light stretching down the hill and shimmering off the blue water of the reservoir below.  The VFR plied the each willingly, and my pace flowed without thought.  Despite the hundreds of miles already covered, hour after hour, the experience continued to be spiritual, the trance of the road all consuming.  I wondered how I had even considered cutting the trip short?</div><br/>

            
            <p>At the north end of Pine Flat resevoir we turned onto Maxxon Rd, a short while later turning again, onto Watts Valley Rd.  These stretches were nearly as good as many of the roads we had been on. I was all becoming a blur in my memory.  The epic trip was still unfolding, even as the sun got lower in the sky.  I had brief thoughts of picking up my wife.  The dash clock said 3pm, and my quick estimates still had me getting home with a a little time to spare.  My fatigue was becoming harder to ignore, and the real world began to creep in like dusk.</p>
            
            <div class="subTitle">Reality and Time Warps</div>
            <p>Watts Valley brought us briefly onto Highway 168.  A stop was required to figure out our plan.  Highway 168 could take us down into Fresno, but there were other options to consider.  Two EOMB members pulled next to each other and chatted. The rest of us sat and waited, helmets on and bikes running.  Meanwhile, local traffic rushed busily passed.  People were doing normal life things; leaving work, picking up kids, running errands, heading home.  I notice a strange look from a passing mini-van, and realized I was an outsider, an alien visiter from another universe.  My helmet and two wheeled vehicle protected me, made it possible for me to observe them as I passed through their world.  The local dwellers had made a sighting, but in a blink we would be gone. </p>
            
            <p>After some hand gestures and nods, we once again we rolled onward, seeking out the fringe roads that skirted reality. We turned off Highway 168, onto Aubery Rd, and soon the twisties started again.  Aubery Rd. went on for a while, then connected us with North Fork Rd.  As the day faded, so did my edge and my ability to make pace on tight roads.  The miles, hours, and days had burned my reserves, and the ice cream novelty lunch had not lasted long.  It felt like I was getting less feed back from the front tire,  so either my brain or the rubber was running out of grip.  I latched on to another rider, letting him do most of the concentration.  The road went on and on.  Time seemed to be standing still, and I started to wonder if we were actually ever going home?  I remembered the goal of picking up my wife, but had no reference to  know the distance or time it would take to get home.</p>
            
            <div>After a last bit of curves, we arrived at Hwy 41, and stopped to regroup.    Knowing where we were, 
            I checked my clock.  By rough calculation, I figured it would I figured would still 
            barely make it to pick up my wife.  I left her a quick message, then tried to relax, 
            enjoying our break.  That was when another rider asked me the time.  I pointed to my dash clock,
            <div class="photoLeft">

	            	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ixab/1732144528/" title="Photo Sharing">
	            	<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2151/1732144528_ce84ee009f.jpg" alt="" /></a>
          	</div>
             and thought I heard a nearby rider laugh.  "That doesn't seem right", he said.    
             I decided to check of my watch, to resolve the issue.   Pulling my watch from my tank bag, 
             I found it was obviously not the right time, either.  More snickering came from the others, 
             and I knew what was going on.  I mused out loud that, for some reason, both my time keeping 
             devices seemed to be wrong. The rider who had first asked  the time just laughed, suggesting we 
             had ridden so fast, we must have created a strange vortex that affected time itself.  By now 
             everyone was laughing, and I knew I had been played.  As the others put their helmets on, I 
             quickly left another message for my wife explaining that, due to a motorcycle derived time warp, 
             she would be taking the bus home from school.</div><br/>
            
            <p>Highway 41 was a fast, civilized stretch, with plenty of traffic.  It was now late afternoon, 
            and we were surely heading home.  I realized there was only 10 of us there, less than half of the 
            original group. My assumption that reaching civilization meant we would relax and roll home was 
            unfounded.  The route we took home, though not twisty, was not exactly relaxing.  Once we were 
            through Madera and out on the farm roads, the pace quickly hit triple digits. I had not switched 
            my dark visor for a clear one, and soon had little more than tail lights to guide me.  We connected 
            the dots on a zig-zag path through the fields, flying past shadowy buildings, collecting countless bugs, 
            the drone of our assault echoing through thick, agricultural air.  At Hwy 152 we regrouped, and I stole 
            a moment to switch to my clear visor. In a way, I wished I had not, because better visibility made me 
            realize how absurd our pace was. Soon we were passing through Los Banos, and the pace became sane again. 
            Turning on to I-5, we casually rolled a few miles north, stopping at Andersen's Pea Soup for dinner.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            
            <div class="subTitle">Finally Home and Reflection</div> 
            <p>Since a few others had taken alternate routes home, there was now six of us, and we took our time at dinner.  As I slurped my pea soup and enjoyed the typical Moto Bro banter, reflecting on the epic day.  Once fed, we geared back up, got fuel, and pointed our bikes north into the blackness of I-5.  As we got closer to home, the six slowly became 5, then 4, then just 2.  As each rider peeled off, they would give a thumbs up, or roll closer for a quick handshake through gloved hands.  As I pulled off my exit, one last rider gave me a wave,  roaring off down the freeway.</p>

            
            <p>Once home, I sat in my driveway, listening to cooling sounds of my bike.  I had survived an epic trip.  Despite years of experience and countless miles, something about this ride was different.  The experience had brought into focus another dimension of riding,  something that I had only caught glimpses of before.  The experiences were not new. I had ridden multiple days in a row, blasted roads at a fate-tempting speeds, enjoyed rowdy nights in small town bars, and bonded with strangers who share my sport.  This trip went beyond a simple combination of those events.  I think the difference was the depth of my immersion.  For 96 hours, I had existed only to ride.  Nothing else was allowed, except for bare necessites, and in most ways those exceptions served to enhance the goal of riding.  There was no schedule or side agenda, no firm plan, except to open the throttle and put rubber to the road.  Riding casually, driving to work, or cruising with friends on a weekend, these are all being a motorcyclist.  To interrupt your life, submerge yourself in riding and riding alone, that is another.  Go one more step, and take all those aspects to an extreme, and experience becomes transcendence.  Once you are immersed, a weekend ride seems almost laughable, commuting borders on sacrildge.  Removed from the parameters and tasks it is normally tasked with, and you make plain the thing about motorcycles that has us all hooked. It is not simply a vehicle, not a means of transportation or entertianment. To be on the bike is to be in motion, on two wheels, moving through space, integrated with the machine and transformed by its freedom and power.  The earth is covered in roads, all of them connected. They call, and we must ride.</p>
