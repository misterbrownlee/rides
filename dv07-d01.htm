            <div class="subTitle">Trip Overview</div>
            <p>The plan was simple: ride from Oakland to Death Valley and back as a tag-along with the East Oakland Moto Bros.</p>
        
            <p>I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive.  Making a 1600 mile run to Death Valley and back was going to 
            be intense on it's own.  Doing the ride as a tag-along with the locally-infamous East Oakland Moto Bros 
            took the intensity level up a notch.  Having watched a video of the Bros on a ride in Baja, it was 
            clear to me the pace would be quick, the regard for safety questionable, and the socializing amply 
            libatious. If I couldn't take the heat I should not even consider coming into the kitchen.  
            Lucky for me, when the invitation was extended, the words "Hell Yeah!" had left my mouth before 
            any of that self-preservation non-sense could spoil the party.</p>
            
            <p>Don't bother searching for info on the E.O.M.B., as they exist almost entirely off the 
            radar of the civilized world.  I guess you would call them a club, though I have not detected 
            much in the way of process or structure to their organization.  It's more like a group of guys 
            who ride together, mainly focused on off-road mayhem,  with a history that goes back for at least 
            several decades.  The most concrete indication of official club status is the ever present 
            skull-and-crossbones sticker, which ends up on unattended motorcycles, road signs, ride 
            regrouping points, dive bar restrooms, abandoned brothel billboards, crash sites, etc.  They 
            seemed like a tight bunch, and since I'm always looking to expand my moto horizons,an invite to 
            join The Bros on their death valley run could not be passed up. My'98 VFR had fresh Pilot 2CT's 
            and was ready to haul ass long distance, so I mounted up my luggage, stuffed it with a 'hell or high-water' 
            selection of gear, and called myself ready.  Trying to sleep the night before departure was worse 
            than being 9 years old and knowing that new BMX bike was downstairs under the Christmas tree.  Morning 
            couldn't come soon enough.</p>
        
            <div class="subTitle">Friday</div>
            <div>Weary eyes told me it was 6am, and morning actually had come soon enough. Excitement made interrupted 
            sleep seem irrelavent. I jumped out of bed, kissed my wife, quickly put on gear, did a last check on the VFR, 
            and pulled out of the garage - into a nice, cold drizzle.  Here we go!  I blasted through my neighborhood

	           	</div>
            to meet the EOMB member that had invited me on the run.  We had to meet the rest of the group at 7am, 
            and at 6:35 this guy is in jeans and a fleece sweatshirt, hurriedly lashing a 3 foot high tower of gear 
            to the back seat of his 919 with bungie cords.  Next came a 3 foot high tank bag on the front, leaving 
            an almost comical amount of space for a rider to wedge on to the seat.  My host slipped on a well used 
            Aerostich, carefully threaded himself into the gear pile, and we were off.   After weaving our way 
            through early commute traffic, briefly pulled off I-580 to connect with the main group, and then 
            zoomed to our first stop, which was Panama Coffee in Livermore. The Bros quickly drank coffee, ate a 
            few muffins, made some introductions, got in a small amount of harassing each other, and then we were off. 
            </div>
            
            <p>From there, we took a somewhat eccentric route through Livermore to the start of Mines Rd.  This route was 
            decided while all 23 bikes were in motion, through a complex process of jockeying for position, elbow tapping, 
            various hand and finger gestures, and a couple of emergency turns.  Once on Mines, group strung out as the pace 
            whipped up.  Mines is a pretty hairy road. It's twisty, tight, beat up, and not well marked.  Add to that some 
            embankments and drop offs, occasional gravel, patches, potholes, barb wire fences, road side rocks and trees, 
            some farm crossings, and, well, you get the idea.   A few of the Bro's took off like Livermore was about to 
            become a nuclear test site, but some kept to a more cautious pace.  I ended up close to DFL, but didn't take that 
            too hard. I'm not one to ride over my head these days, and that's pretty easy to do on Mines. Considering I had 
            never ridden Mines before, nor had I ridden the VFR fully loaded, DFL was a much better option than DNF.  With a 
            four day plan on the table, I was determined to finish the first 40 miles with the shiny side up.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>From the regroup we followed Del Puerto Canyon Road to Patterson for a fuel stop.  After that, the relatively 
            dull pace through Patterson and Turlock was made more interesting by is best described as 'hooliganism'. This 
            allowed me to witness one of the funniest things I've ever seen on a motorcycle.  Just as we were leaving a stop 
            sign, one of the Bros rode up to another, close behind and just to the right.  The pair were just in front of me, 
            and I had a perfect view of what came next. With his free left hand, the approaching rider deftly retrieved a bottle 
            of sport drink from the gear bungied to the other rider's back seat.  Bottle in hand, he sped up a bit, offering this 
            treasure to the clearly surprised rider, who had so careful stashed his drink at the last stop. Being caught off guard, 
            the rider did what came naturally, and reached out with his throttle hand to grab the bottle!  Of course, you know what 
            happened next.  The prankster made a huge gesture that exclaimed "DUH! OH NO!", then sped off. The victim slowed on his 
            now powerless bike, staring down at the drink bottle!  I laughed until tears were soaking my cheek pads, and still have 
            a hard time picturing the whole thing without giggling uncontrollably.  The gesture of the prankster as he sped off said 
            it all, and the whole thing was simply classic.</p>

           	</div>
            
            <div>From Turlock, we made our way across the central valley, looking for interesting roads to connect the 
            dots between us and the Sierras with more on-the-fly finger pointing, hand signals, arm waving, and head 
            shaking used to determine the route. J17 took us through Turlock and Snelling, J16 led us out toward Merced Falls. 
            Once the evidence of civilization started to thin out, the speed picked up.  It occurred to me I didn't know what 
            the speed rating was on my Givi soft luggage.  I was about to find out.  Somewhere ahead of me was a Hayabusa with 
            a radar detector, but I still felt like triple digit speeds were asking a bit much of our karma, especially with 
            the ride only a few hours underway. A turn onto Hornitos Rd made things even more lively.  This road whoops that 
            would make a supercross track proud, such that the VFR seemed dangerously close to catching air.  Just as I was 
            doing the 'Jumping + VFR = Bad' math, the VStrom in front of me took flight over the next whoop.  Not Good. I 
            backed off, rolling over the crest with suspension light and tires just barely in contact with terra-firma, just 
            in time to see a laid out VStrom and an Aerostich clad rag-doll disappear off the side of the road into and explosion 
            of dust!  Track instincts took over, my left hand shot up, and I passed the downed rider and pulled over just up the 
            road.   In just a few minutes 10 more riders had stopped, the crashed rider was up, and a huddle of Moto Bros had 
            surrounded the scene.  With an ingenuity that would make McGyver proud, they used a metric socket to replace the sheared 
            off rearset, straightened the bars to a rideable degree, and made a quick test run to see if the bike was road worthy.  
            Dusted off and wits collected, the rider climbed aboard, and we were off again, almost as if nothing had happened.  I was 
            to find out over the next few days that this is the way the Bros do business.  Ride hard, maybe stuff it, do some damage 
            control, have a yelling match over how to fix things, then patch things together, saddle up, and get back to it.</div>
        
            <div>After this first incident, the pace slowed down, but only for about an hour or so.  
            We cruised on Hwy 49 over to Coultier, regrouped quickly, then found our way to Hwy 120.  
            For those of you unfamiliar, let it be known that Hwy 120 is a sweet, sweet road, boasting 
            new pavement, positive camber, mostly good sight lines, and incredible views.  As I blasted 
            apex after apex, it sank in how much great pavement lies just beyond the 'day trip' limitation 
            of most rides.  It takes a while for me to get to that point of transparency, where the mental 
            bond with a bike and all it's variables causes the mechanics of riding to melt away. The VFR was 
            still keeping me a bit on edge, or perhaps it was my bad habits that were making the VFR tense?  
            Either way, it was out there on Hwy 120 that the VFR and I started to work out a compromise.

           	</div> 
           	Our corner speed picked up, my grin width got wider, and the road twisted on.</div><br/>
            
            <div>We stuck with Hwy 120 until it changed to Hwy 108, following that into the Sierra foothills. 
            Somewhere around Sonora the one of the Superhawks coughed and wheezed, its rider giving us the 
            dreaded point to the fuel tank.  Reserve was gone; time to pour in the 1 gallon bottle that was 
            lashed to his tail section.  The swarm didn't flinch or look back, so I assumed the rider knew the 
            drill, and would catch up soon.  The rest of the pack roared on, heading toward Strawberry, which 
            was vaguely mentioned as a place the group would grab lunch.  I came to learn that the culinary bar 
            for this trip would hover somewhere down around 'edible', and that the words 'microwave' and 'burrito' 
            should not be uttered in the same sentence.  However, riding was our focus, and anything else was 
            held in questionable regard.</div>

            </div>
            <div>Fed and fueled, the swarm left the foothills behind and wound it's way up Sonora Pass and into the Sierras.  
            By the town of Cow Creek we were strung out again, and I tried to keep aware of where I was in the pack.  
            After a few miles of turns, a sweeping expanse opened on the downhill side of the pass, and the vista seemed 
            to warrant a quick stop for pictures.  Once back on, I clipped along through the peak of the pass, just catching a 
            couple of slower riders at the top.  I twisted my way down the back side, captivated by the alpine scenery.  
            Nearing the bottom, the shutterbug urge called again, so I parked at a good vista.  A couple riders passed, 
            and I waved the thumbs up.  I snapped a couple shots, then a couple more, then a couple of the bike, and then 
           	a couple more while riding.  Once I put the camera way, I got on throttle, heading for the re-group point at Hwy 395. 
            As I pulled up, it looked like most - well, okay - all of the other riders were waiting. An exaggerated 'tipping one back' gesture
            made it clear that causing the group to wait means buying a round of drinks. I had heard rumor that there were many ways 
            <div class="photoRight">

           	</div>
            to end up on the hook for drinks, and figured I was just getting it out of the way early.</div><br/>
        
            <div>In fact, it only took a few minutes to witness another way to earn the 'privilege' of buying the EOMB a round.  
            Just after leaving a quick fuel top-off in Bridgeport, we saw another rider in our group standing next to his SV650.  
            Unfortunately, the dreaded white-top Crown Victoria Interceptor was parked along side as well.  The edge of town and the 
           	'SPEED LIMIT 65' sign was only a few hundred yards further on, but being in sight of the sign obviously didn't make 
           	the local LEO feel generous.  Of course, if you end up talking to law enforcement, you should also plan on 
            talking to a bartender while you buy the Bros a round!</div>
        
            <p>We quickly passed Mono Lake, then took in some breath taking views as we wound our way up to the day's 
            end point, the town of June Lake.  In typical 'organized-chaos' fashion, we got our room situation figured 
            out, then headed to The Tiger Bar for dinner. There was a lot of excitement in the air, and I'm sure our 
            group could be heard on the other side of town (about 8 buildings away).  The penalty rounds of drinks 
            were bought and enjoyed.  Compared to a crash and a speeding ticket, buying a few drinks for taking 
            photos seemed like I got off pretty easy, though the task comes with a healthy amount of laughing at 
            your expense.  However, the seemly endless stories about others who have committed your offense makes 
            you realize you're in good company.  There was also plenty of stories about past Death Valley runs, 
            off-road trips, random drinking experiences, bad ex-girlfriends, police chases, court rooms, hospital 
            stays, and subjects not fit for a publication of this quality.  Anything and everything related to 
            living life to the fullest was shouted over drinks, with laughter nearly constant, and four other stories 
            waiting to follow suit.</p>
